# Maze-Farmer
Farm as much as possible!
Start off your farm by building a soil holder and getting soil from the rocket.
To get more seeds, you will have to enter the caves and go through various mazes, each different than the last.
Plant your new seeds, then harvest them and earn coins!
Make sure your battery doesn't die though, charge it in the rocket.
You can hold up to two extra items in your backpack, and you have a storage in the rocket.
